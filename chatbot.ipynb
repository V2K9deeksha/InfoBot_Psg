All the labs are attached with multimedia projector and wall mounted screen. There are special labs like: * Network Science Lab - provide tools and technology to students to model real world problems such as virus spreads, protein interactions., etc as networks and to apply the network science concepts to yield interesting insights and results using Python and R. This lab also provides a great platform to do research in the growing fields in Network Science like epidemic models and social network analysis * Interactive Intelligence Lab - an applied research lab focusing on research problems across allied domains of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing. This lab provides an environment for the students to learn and implement algorithms that have enabled intelligent software agents and motivates students to develop algorithms that would impact the research community. * Object Computing Lab - provides an environment for the students to gain an understanding of the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and implement them in languages such as C++, JAVA. It is also intended for learning and applying required design patterns that will enable the students to design and develop real-time object-oriented systems. * The Secure Computing Laboratory - to advance the research and education in the areas of computer security and privacy. This lab was established in 2020. The objective of this laboratory is to provide the infrastructure for research and education in various aspects of security in computing. This lab is equipped with 42 high-end configuration computers and smart display boards. * Embedded and IOT lab - for exploring multidisciplinary research related to computer networks, wireless technology etc. This lab enables students to transform real time problems and ideas into customized solutions with a highly interconnected network.\"\n","            ]\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"tag\":\"scholarship\",\n","            \"patterns\":[\n","                \"Scholarships\",\n","                \"Scholarship Programme\",\n","                \"Are scholarships offered to students of this college?\",\n","                \"Will college provide scholarships?\",\n","                \"Does college provide any scholarships?\"\n","            ],\n","            \"responses\":[\n","                \"The college has certain government and non-government schoarships.
